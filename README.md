- 👋 Hello, GitHub!
  My name is Gustavo Vuolo. I'm from Cuiabá, but for now I'm living in Rio de Janeito city, in Brazil.
  
  🔭 I have a Bachelor’s degree in Architecture and Urban Planner from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), and in March 2025 I've been started a new graduation degree in Systems Analysis and Development at Faculdade SENAC RJ (March 2025 - July 2027).  
  Combining my career as an architect with my future career as dev will be a challenge, but I’m ready to work hard and learn!
