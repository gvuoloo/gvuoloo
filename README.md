- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, GitHub!
  My name is Gustavo Vuolo. I'm from CuiabÃ¡, but for now I'm living in Rio de Janeito city, in Brazil.
  
  ðŸ”­ I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Architecture and Urban Planner from UFRJ, and in march 2025 I've been started a new graduation degree in Systems Analysis and Development in Faculdade SENAC RJ.
  Combining my career as an architect with my future career as dev will be a challenge, but Iâ€™m ready to work hard and learn!
